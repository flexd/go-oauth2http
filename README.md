go-oauth2http
=============

Go library for easily adding required oauth2 resources.

Design goal is to be simple to configure, modular, easy to add, and work
with just net/http.

See http://godoc.org/github.com/jtolds/go-oauth2http

Also see the examples at:
https://github.com/jtolds/go-oauth2http/blob/master/examples/group/main.go
https://github.com/jtolds/go-oauth2http/blob/master/examples/one/main.go

Contrast to https://github.com/GoIncremental/negroni-oauth2, which requires
negroni.
